### General overview
Setting up a development framework requires to first define the tools and 
dependancies necessary to develop and test one' software or one's library. The 
goalpost being here that anyone aspiring to contribute to the project might do 
so promptly and easily. Furthermore, should an issue appear during the 
installation or the test phase, iterations to solve that problem will be 
minimized, as the development environment will be fixed. Any arising problem 
would thus be probably coming from the code itself and not be due to a 
dependancy that hasn't been updated.  

For many programming languages, we find packages manager available in a more 
or less evolved form. Specifying the environment can be achieved through a 
text file entirely assembled by one person's hand. This is the case in Python 
with the *requirements.txt* text file, used by pip, and which allows to list 
a collection of packages. The limits of this approach are that it is easy to 
forget one dependancy, and that it can be difficult to clearly explicit which 
version(s) of the dependancies are relevant.  
Similar issues arise in the [conda](https://docs.conda.io/) universe, and in 
particular with [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) as it hosts an 
assortment of packages created and published by the community. These packages 
are not necessarily written with a specific programming language. They might 
be written in either C++, Python, R or other languages. Setting up a conda 
development environment requires to place a *environment.yml* text file, 
which might constitute a doorway for human errors. 
[Spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) allows to define various recipes for 
the compilation of one' software, as well as its dependancies.
